# products

This FastAPI application connects to a MongoDB database to manage an e-commerce system. 
It includes APIs to list products with filters and pagination, create new user orders, and retrieve orders by user ID. 
Pydantic models ensure data validation, while a helper function formats MongoDB documents for JSON responses.
